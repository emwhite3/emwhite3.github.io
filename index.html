    <strong>About</strong>
    <p>I am currently a Junior at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) majoring in Computer Science. My interests include Computer Hardware and Cyber Security. I enjoy logic puzzles/challenges as well as a deep love/hate relationship with 
        programming. <br />Outside of academics I am invloved in the UTEP Marching Miners as standing trombone section leader as well as a Student Webmaster at UTEP. 
    </p>
    <p>I have lived in El Paso since birth and have spent so much time not only learning from traditional teachers, but from the community here as well. There is such a rich culture here that has helped
        shape me into the person that I am today.

    <strong>Side Project - Reverse Engineering Poison Tap</strong>
    <p>The poison Tap project is a script that (when injected into a pi zero), places a basic backdoor into the target computer to access the router it is connected to, gathers all cookies, and fowards information remotely to you.
        I am currently working to understand the functionality of this code and replicate it with my own flare.
